# Leap Years TDD Exercise for London's Callling

This is the Leap Years exercise presented at London's Calling by Chris Aldridge on February 5th, 2016.

The exercise is a walkthrough of how to apply Test Driven Development to a simple problem: calculating whether or not a date is a leap year.

##Code Structure

Each iteration of the code is versioned with a major and minor version. Each major version is the adding of a new requirement, with subsequent sub-versions being the updating of the code to make the test pass, and refactoring (if applicable).
