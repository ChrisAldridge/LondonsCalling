    Unit test class for first iteration of the leap year service.
    
    Code has been written to satisfy the first test. Test now passes.
    
    Requirements met:
    âˆš   If the year is before 1582, then it is not a leap year
    x   If the year is divisible by four but not 100, then it is a leap year
    x   If the year is divisible by 100, but NOT 400, it is NOT a leap year
    x   If the year is divisible by 100 AND by 400, then it is a leap year
    x   Otherwise, not a leap year
